                <p>I originally started with digital design during 2011-2014 in which I worked heavily with adobe products like Illustrator CC 2013 and good old photoshop. It wasn’t till late 2014 where I ended up focusing heavily on video editing and directing via my college electives classes. I got the opportunity to work on school projects and tried my hand at working with other editors on local movies around the Miami area. It was in mid 2016 after visiting a local workshop for ruby on rails in which I ended up having an interest in coding. I did free courses on Code academy. Udemy, Code-kata, you name it.</p>
                <p>On late 2016, I ended up getting more heavily involved in coding as it has become my passion for doing, I ended up going to local coding meet-ups, attended hackathons, signed up for Github, etc. On December 2016 I finished my associate degree and was in the proccess of trying to find which school to transfer for my BA. For my coding profession I still couldnt find ruby on rails opportunities by my area and told myself there was more to improve and branch out in other in languages such as Javascript. From then on till currently now, I’m spending my days improving more on skills, working on solo projects, doing client work for either logo design to simple web design here and there.</p>
